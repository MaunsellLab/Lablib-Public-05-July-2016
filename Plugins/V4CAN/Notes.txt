V4CAN V4 Correlation, Attention and Normalization

V4CAN was a plugin for Bram Verhoef's project (2012).  It was used for a while, but his monkey (Tintin) could
never learn to ignore the distractor stimuli effectively.  We eventually revised the task to use a different
design with no distractors.  That project was VICAN.  V4CAN was never used to collect neurophysiology data. 


Current:

Behavior Window:
    Detect when the maximum time changes
    Plot by target index, not time.

Put % of each trial length as display in diagnostics window
Sector shaped eye windows?



Need to reinstruct after a given number of errors
Need to prevent eye samples from getting into the header of data files (starting ITC before trialStart).


File header:
    Missing Eccentricity Polar Angle and Response time
    Including: spurious eye sample data before first trial
    
Eye window calibrator was not being redrawn correctly on the rig
May want to remove setFrame calls for Gabors, and remove the drawing on intermediate frames
Need to compute trial length allowing for jitter interstim when computing reward size

Need to add pupil size to the eyeXY Display

CONVERSION TO FOUR GABORS:

Need to make the far stimulus pairs locked to the RF pairs so that they remain fixed across attend locations
Spikes are not being assigned to the correct histograms and the correct plots

Need to clean up the data events that describe task timing and stimuli (announceEvents)
